#Summary of acf and pacf plot:
#ACF slowly decreases (not dies down). This indicates the need of differencing.
#ACF of first order diffrencing of Log XU100 in USD, is indicating significant value till lag 1 and then ACF cuts approximately.
#PACF of Log XU100 in USD, indicating significant value till lag 2 and then PACF cuts.
#PACF of diffrencing Log XU100 in USD, indicating significant value till lag 2 and then PACF cuts approximately.

#Combining all above findings, we can conclude that the tentative model can be assumed as ARIMA(2,1,1),
#but should be verified by AIC based criteria.

#Order of ARCH by AIC
#The order of ARCH components should be selected by AIC values obtained from different choices.
#I am here defining a new R function called â€™myAIC()â€™ for ARCH model
#The function â€™garchâ€™ from â€™TSAâ€™ package can be used for ARCH, setting order for GARCH components to â€™zeroâ€™.
